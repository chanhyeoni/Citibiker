For this homework, we made some changes to the history table such that the pre-processed version splits the times into month, day, year, hour, and minute. We will run the aggregation queries to see the actual results using the history data.

# create another table
create external table history_table(tripduration int, start_id string, start_name string, start_lat float, start_long float, end_id string, end_name string, end_lat float, end_long float, bikeid string, usertype string, birthyear string, gender string, starttime_month string, starttime_day string, starttime_year string, starttime_hour string, starttime_min string, stoptime_month string, stoptime_day string, stoptime_year string, stoptime_hour string, stoptime_min string, garbage bigint) row format delimited fields terminated by ','  location  ‘/user/cl1568/Preprocess_MapReduce/part-r-00000’;
